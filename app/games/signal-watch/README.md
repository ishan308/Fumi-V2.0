# Signal Watch

Game 2 of FUMI (Greenwood river relay). It's a sustained-attention and
impulse-control game. Three relay towers stand beside a moving river full
of noise: leaves, fish, bubbles and ripples. Now and then a tower fires the
real signal, three rings spreading from its gem, and the child taps that
tower. Every other pulse is a scored decoy the child must not tap.

Skills: sustained attention, impulse control, vigilance, false-alarm
inhibition. Difficulty: medium. Target length: 3.5–4 minutes.

## Flow

1. **Start screen:** the wooden title sign, the parchment card and Play.
2. **How to play:** Fumi's narration, the child rule, and a looping
   example of all 8 signal types (Tap! / Ignore).
3. **Tutorial:** Fumi labels a two-ring ripple "Ignore", a single flash
   "Ignore", and a three-ring pulse "That's it — tap!". The tutorial waits
   until the child taps that tower.
4. **Practice:** 5 mixed events, unscored, with live captions.
5. **Blocks 1–3** (scored): 10 real signals + 20 decoys each, so 30 + 60
   in total. The scene never stops; each block opens with a short banner.
6. **Completion:** stats, stars, 100 XP, coins, the River Stone, the
   Hunter Badge (if FIST), and a choice of 1 of 3 accessories.

## Events

- **Real signal:** three concentric rings from the gem (in the tower's
  colour), with ripples at the base.
- **Decoys (scored):** two-ring ripple, single-ring flash, reflected
  sunlight, bubbles, fish splash, leaf cluster, harmless blue spark. Later
  blocks lean on one- and two-ring pulses, the most tempting look-alikes.
- **Background (unscored, `components/RiverLife.tsx`):** drifting leaves,
  jumping fish, bubbles and ripples, clipped to the river. Ages 11–16 get
  more of everything.

Real-signal onsets are jittered 2.5–7 s apart. Decoys fill the time
between them and may overlap an event on another tower (never two on one
tower, at most 2 on screen, never starting within 350 ms of a real signal).
This overlap is what makes withholding the tap hard.

## Responses

- **Hit:** tap the tower showing three rings, or within 450 ms after they
  vanish. Fumi hops on her raft, a relay beam fires to the next tower
  (blue → purple → gold → blue), and the route line advances.
- **False alarm:** tap a decoy, an idle tower, or the wrong tower. A very
  short mist puff appears, with no words and no cross.
- **Miss:** the scene doesn't pause. Practice only shows a gentle hint.

## Difficulty (`config.ts` → `AGE_BAND_CONFIG`)

| | 6–10 | 11–16 |
|---|---|---|
| Visible time per block (ms) | 1500 / 1300 / 1100 | 1100 / 900 / 750 |
| Gaps between real signals | 2.5–7 s, shorter early | 2.8–7 s, skewed long |
| Decoy mix | Mostly obvious decoys; look-alikes rise in block 3 | Look-alike rings from block 1 |
| Background river motion | Normal | High |

## Metrics (`engine/metrics.ts`, scored blocks only)

- total real signals; real signals detected; detection accuracy %; real
  signals missed
- total distractors; distractors tapped (also split by type); distractor
  rejection accuracy %
- average response time to real signals
- performance per vigilance block (detection, rejection, average response)
- gameplay duration (paused time excluded)
- also: wrong-tower taps and idle-tower taps

## Rewards

- Completing the game gives 100 XP, 25 coins, and the River Stone
  collectible.
- **FIST** means detection accuracy and distractor rejection accuracy are
  both at least 90%. It adds 5 coins (30 total), the Hunter Badge, and
  3 stars.
- The child picks 1 of 3 accessories: Signal Goggles, River Cape, Pulse
  Charm.

## Art

- `backgrounds/river-towers.jpg` (1170×2100): the mockup's river scene,
  upscaled 4× with Real-ESRGAN. `falls-mask.png` and `river-mask.png` are
  alpha masks of the water, used by the flow animations in
  `components/LivingScene.tsx`. Regenerate them if the background changes.
- `ui/title-sign.png`: the title sign, upscaled and cut out.
- `collectibles/river-stone.png`: the River Stone, upscaled 4×.
- Tower gem, base and tap-zone positions (`TOWERS`) and the raft position
  (`RAFT`) in `config.ts` are measured off the background.
